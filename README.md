# ABVCalculator App
This application calculates estimated percentage alcohol by volume (ABV) of homebrew beers.

## Installation Instructions
There isn't a way to install it yet.

## Roadmap:
These are the things I want to accomplish:
* Take as inputs "Starting original gravity" and "Final Gravity"
* Calculate the estimated ABV
* Return the ABV on the console
